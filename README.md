# vistrian-data

This module is designed to patch holey vistrian data (data with gaps in random columns at random times), exported as a .csv from the 
web interface.

If you simply want to patch data and don't need to customize anything, or install python, 
you can just download the .exe -- that is, as soon as I get py2exe to compile it.
