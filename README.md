# vistrian-data
If you've ever used Vistrian, you know that it really sucks.  
This module is designed to patch holey vistrian data, exported as a .csv from the 
web interface.

If you simply want to patch data and don't need to customize anything, or install python, 
you can just download the .exe -- that is, as soon as I get py2exe to compile it.
